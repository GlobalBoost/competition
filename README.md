# Intro about Impact and Globalboost
Impact Protocol is one of the first chains with a hybrid consensus mechanism. It has the power of both PoW(proof of work) and PoS(proof of stake). The Impact protocol is built on a substrate framework, and it is a modular framework that allows developers to be easy and efficient. Impact follows the thought process of building a multichain future. It will have multiple parachains connected/integrated and running in parallel, with thousands of TPS. Globalboost is the sister blockchain which was started around 8 years before and forms the basic for the Impact Protocol
